Generate Access Token \u00b6 First, you need a key (called \"access token\") to access the resources you own on canvas. The key can be generated in the /profile/settings webpage on canvas. For example, in UMJI, it is https://umjicanvas.com/profile/settings . In the Approved Integrations section, use New Access Token to generate a key. The generated key will be shown here. It is Yy8WeJFndZ2oeorbQ3K0TMJ98u4l5QvftTe1YQgaemFVfxvNsLexSSja7SYx6hgX . Please keep this key secret, do not give to anyone else because it can provide the whole access to your canvas account. You need to save this key somewhere because Once you leave this page you won't be able to retrieve the full token anymore, you'll have to regenerate it to get a new value. Obtain Course and Assignment ID \u00b6 Open the assignment you want to grade on canvas, you can easily find the Course ID and Assignment ID in the navbar. For example, the url is https://umjicanvas.com/courses/786/assignments/7081 , so the Course ID is 786 and the Assignment ID is 7081 . Create a Rubric (with a Rubric ID) \u00b6 You can then create a rubric (or select an existing one) on the same page. The way to get Rubric ID is a bit more tricky. Assuming that you are using Chrome, right click the name of the rubric and select Chrome Devtools (or \u68c0\u67e5 , \u5ba1\u67e5\u5143\u7d20 ), the rubric id will be shown in the dev tools. If you can't find out that the Rubric ID is 182 , please close this page and go to doctor. (CR. Reapor-Yurnero when playing DoTA2 ) Note for UM-JI Users \u00b6 The version of canvas is never updated in JI. In the current version, the rubric function of canvas is a beta version, which has some bugs. If a rubric is just created and never used, this tool won't work and will throw an error. You can give a random score to any student (e.g., Test Student) in an assignment using this rubric in the SpeedGrader before running this tool. Don't worry about the random score because all scores will be updated after running this tool.","title":"Canvas Workflow"},{"location":"workflow/#canvas-workflow","text":"Please carefully follow the steps listed below.","title":"Canvas Workflow"},{"location":"workflow/#generate-access-token","text":"First, you need a key (called \"access token\") to access the resources you own on canvas.
